      <dt><h4>About</h4></dt>
      <dd><p>A browser based tool for exploring the history of word usage in English texts. The program allows to graph how popular was a chosen word in a given year in English texts starting from 1470. User can enter multiple words and choose a time span of interest.</p></dd>
      <dt><h4>Skills</h4></dt>
      <dd><p>The project had an emphasis on creating a custom data structure that would allow handling large amounts of data in an efficient manner. I learned how to work with big data, parse large cvs files, and manipulate the extracted data. Additionally, I had to do a bit of software engineering to set up a web server that can handle NgordnetQueries.</p></dd>

      <dt><h4>About</h4></dt>
      <dd><p>A Tic-Tac-Toe game that can be played with another person or a computer player. Playing against the computer makes no sense because you can never beat it :)</p></dd>
      <dt><h4>Skills</h4></dt>
      <dd><p>In this project, I learned about java GUI libraries. Buttons, fields, and event listeners - all that was new for me as I was building my first Java application with a GUI ever!</p></dd>

      <dt><h4>About</h4></dt>
      <dd><p>A web app that uses AI to recognize whether a wolf-looking animal on a picture is an actual Wolf, Coyote, Dog, or Fox.</p></dd>
      <dt><h4>Skills</h4></dt>
      <dd><p>Building this app, I became familiar with the underlying principles of neural networks, machine learning, and artificial intelligence. I learned how to pick the right model, training data of proper size and quality, and how to train the model then.</p></dd>

    <h3>Open Source contribution to Pytorch</h3>

    <dl>
      <dt><h4>Languages & Tools</h4></dt>
      <dd><p><img src="python.png" alt="Python logo" width=70></p></dd>
      <dt><h4>About</h4></dt>
      <dd><p>Working with two other students, made our very first contribution to an open-source project. Our mentor picked for us an open bug that seemed to be moderately difficult but turned out to be a deeply rooted version compatibility issue.</p></dd>
      <dt><h4>Skills</h4></dt>
      <dd><p>In this project, I learned what it means to dive head-on into an entirely unknown codebase of hundreds of thousands of lines of code. At times we were totally lost, and at times just super frustrated. But we cheered each other up and didn't give up. Only through efficient teamwork and close collaboration were we able to identify the root of the problem and find a fix to it.</p></dd>

    <h3>Scheme Interpreter</h3>
    <img class="project-images" src="scheme.png" alt="Scheme Project Cover" width=250>
    <dl>
      <dt><h4>Languages & Tools</h4></dt>
      <dd><p><img src="python.png" alt="Python logo" width=70><img src="vs_code.png" alt="VS Code logo" width=70><img src="scheme_logo.png" alt="Scheme Language logo" width=70></p></dd>
      <dt><h4>About</h4></dt>
      <dd><p>The Scheme Interpreter project involved creating an interpreter for a subset of the Scheme programming language. The project required implementing the evaluation and application of Scheme expressions, as well as handling special forms and creating classes to describe Scheme expressions.</p></dd>
      <dt><h4>Skills</h4></dt>
      <dd><p>For this project, I had to learn the Scheme language and underlying principles of its work. I learned how to implement the evaluation and application of Scheme expressions, as well as handle special forms and create classes to describe Scheme expressions. Debugging and testing of my code took significant time as the project involved a lot of corner cases. Additionally, I gained experience with designing and implementing an interpreter for a programming language and get a better understanding how programming languages function behind the scenes. I had to think about the issues that arise in the design of a programming language and consider how they can impact the implementation of an interpreter. Working with a partner, I got a chance to further improve my teamwork, leadership, and collaboration skills.</p></dd>

    <h3>Ants vs. Some Bees</h3>
    <img class="project-images" src="antsandbees.png" alt="Ants vs. Bees Project Cover" width=600>
    <dl>
      <dt><h4>Languages & Tools</h4></dt>
      <dd><p><img src="python.png" alt="Python logo" width=70><img src="vs_code.png" alt="VS Code logo" width=70></p></dd>
      <dt><h4>About</h4></dt>
      <dd><p>Ants vs. Some Bees is a tower defence computer game. As the ant queen, you populate your colony with the bravest ants you can muster. Your ants must protect their queen from the evil bees that invade your territory. Irritate the bees enough by throwing leaves at them, and they will be vanquished. Fail to pester the airborne intruders adequately, and your queen will succumb to the bees' wrath. This game is inspired by PopCap Games' Plants Vs. Zombies.</p></dd>
      <dt><h4>Skills</h4></dt>
      <dd><p>The implementation involved a lot of object-oriented programming. I implemented various ant types, including HarvesterAnts and ThrowerAnts, and created a system for bees to move through the tunnel and attack ants. I also had to consider concepts such as health, food costs, and turn order to make the game functioning properly. This was a pretty large project, so efficient teamwork was very important.</p></dd>

      <dd><p><img src="python.png" alt="Python logo" width=70><img src="vs_code.png" alt="VS Code logo" width=70></p></dd>
      <dt><h4>About</h4></dt>
      <dd><p>Hog is a dice simulator game. Players take turns rolling dices and trying to be the first to reach a certain number of points. User can play against another person or a computer player. Computer can choose one of the playing strategies ranging from a naive one to a quite sophisticated and hard-to-beat one. There are special rules for rolling zero dice and reaching perfect square scores.</p></dd>
      <dt><h4>Skills</h4></dt>
      <dd><p>Working on the Hog project, I got practice with programming skills in Python, including use of control statements and higher-order functions. I also learned how to design and implement a simulation for a dice game and various playing strategies. I practiced debugging and testing my code. Additionally, working with a partner provided me with the chance to improve my teamwork and collaboration skills.</p></dd>
