        <dd><p>
            The back-end, implemented with Java/Spring, interacts with various web platforms such as Yelp using Selenium. 
            Users of these platforms can request and promptly receive custom quotes and availability provided by the app. 
            The Quoting API is also utilized by the website and a desktop CLI app.
        </p>
        <p>
            The app analyzes quote requests to determine the options the business can offer. 
            The company typically has multiple teams working in different areas on jobs of varying sizes, starting and finishing at different times. 
            The teams themselves can consist of 2-6 members, use different sizes of trucks, and require different sets of equipment.
        </p>
        <p>
            In performing this analysis, the app considers the current schedule and all relevant factors related to the teams. 
            It strives to balance customer convenience, minimize idle driving miles and team hours, and ensure that an appropriately sized truck with the necessary equipment is provided. 
            If a perfect match isn't possible, the program suggests alternative options and may offer a discount if the customer agrees to a less convenient time.
        </p>
        <p>
            Once the customer sends a booking request, the job is added to the spreadsheets and calendar via Google APIs, 
            followed by the customer and each member of the assigned team receiving email and SMS notifications. 
            The day before the job, the customer and each team member receive another SMS asking them to confirm their readiness for the move. 
            If someone does not confirm, the manager is notified.
        </p><p>
            Additional functions include requesting feedback and reviews, tracking revenue and expenses, performing accounting, 
            monitoring a database of blacklisted customers among moving companies, and keeping track of important due dates.

            <dt><h4>Motivation</h4></dt>
            <dd><p>As I was taking my first Java course, I was also helping my friend to start a moving company. One of my
                responsibilities was responding to a lot of quote requests every day. It was a repetitive task that required a quick and
                accurate response. Sometimes I would spend too much time doing calculations, so the customer would move forward
                with another business, and sometimes I would make mistakes in a hurry. That's when I decided to apply my
                just-learned programming skills to improve my efficiency.</p></dd>
            <dt><h4>First Launch</h4></dt>
            <dd><p>A month later I rolled out my first build. The product was raw and downright terrible. My program would crash
                every few hours and I often had to spend long nights testing and debugging. Quite often I would sit in a class
                and a customer would write something ridiculous in their quote request sending my software to a crash and
                requiring me to respond to quotes manually.</p></dd>
            <dt><h4>Results</h4></dt>
            <dd><p>Despite a bumpy start, the initiative turned out a tremendous success. 
                Customers loved our quick and detailed quotes and booked their moves with us by the time others managed to reply. 
                The app reduced the manager's (that's also me)
                workload by 80% and increased the business' revenue by 150%. As time went by and I was becoming a better
                programmer, I was improving my code and even had to rewrite almost the entire project twice. Throughout the
                years, the app got many new features and became a robust product.</p></dd>

                <li>I found out how to use Spring framework for accepting and handling HTTP requests.</li>
                <li>I figured out how to deploy my app to the cloud, so that it is reliably available 24/7.</li>
                <li>Before I studied multithreading in class, I learned about the concept on my own and implemented that cool feature in my app.</li>
                <li>I learned best front-end practices, picked up React, and got come practice with HTML, CSS, and Figma.</li>

        <dd><p>This project is a React application that allows users to upload an image of a design, process it using the OpenAI API and generate code based on it. It utilizes the Greptile API for processing GitHub repositories and generating code. 
            Greptile knows your repo like a senior developer, so it will tell you exactly what files need to be updated to get the desired design.

            For the front-end, I decided to experiment and, instead of using the familiar Bootstrap,
            tried out Semantic UI, which I found to be very convenient and intuitive.
            Lastly, I gained hands-on experience with Redis.

            and read what they are most interested about. 
            Users can also sign up to be able to post, edit, and delete articles of their own. 
            The app has accounts with admin priveleges. Admins can create new categories, edit and delete any articles, and also delete user profiles. 
        </p></dd>
        <dt><h4>Skills</h4></dt>
        <dd><p>Implementing this project provided me with a comprehensive understanding of how Rails applications are built.
            I gained insights into the responsibilities of each part of the MVC (Model-View-Controller) framework and learned
            how migrations work. I also developed proficiency in creating CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete)
            functions and managing multiple resources.
            <br><br>
            Additionally, I built an authentication system from scratch and utilized Bootstrap for front-end development.
            I worked with one-to-many and many-to-many associations at the database layer and successfully deployed 
            the project to a production environment. 
            This project also allowed me to practice my skills with both Bootstrap and Ruby.

        <dd><p>In this project, I built a 2D tile-based world exploration engine that generates pseudorandom levels. One of
            the most complex parts of the project was writing an algorithm that would draw rooms and hallways such that all
            the spaces are connected and no walls break into open space. User can save their progress, load the saved game
            and continue playing. Additional features include character animations, cut scenes, and sound effects.
            The player's task is to explore the level and eliminate all the monsters. Once the level is cleared, the boss
            will show up for the final fight.
        </p></dd>
        <dt><h4>Skills</h4></dt>
        <dd><p>This long software engineering project required a great deal of exploration and experimentation. The goal was
            to practice handling a larger piece of code in the hopes of emulating something
            like a product development cycle. It was a large design project that required me to work through every stage of
            development from ideation to presentation.
            Some of the most interesting aspects of the project were designing gameplay, adding music and sounds, and
            creating character animations.

            handling special forms and creating classes to describe Scheme expressions.</p></dd>
        <dt><h4>Skills</h4></dt>
        <dd><p>For this project, I had to learn the Scheme language and underlying principles of its work. I learned how to
            implement the evaluation and application of Scheme expressions, as well as handle special forms and create
            classes to describe Scheme expressions. Debugging and testing of my code took significant time as the project
            involved a lot of corner cases. Additionally, I gained experience with designing and implementing an interpreter
            for a programming language and get a better understanding how programming languages function behind the scenes.
            I had to think about the issues that arise in the design of a programming language and consider how they can
            impact the implementation of an interpreter. Working with a partner, I got a chance to further improve my

        <dt><h4>About</h4></dt>
        <dd><p>Ants vs. Some Bees is a tower defence computer game. As the ant queen, you populate your colony with the
            bravest ants you can muster. Your ants must protect their queen from the evil bees that invade your territory.
            Irritate the bees enough by throwing leaves at them, and they will be vanquished. Fail to pester the airborne
            intruders adequately, and your queen will succumb to the bees' wrath. This game is inspired by PopCap Games'
            Plants Vs. Zombies.</p></dd>
        <dt><h4>Skills</h4></dt>
        <dd><p>The implementation involved a lot of object-oriented programming. I implemented various ant types, including
            HarvesterAnts and ThrowerAnts, and created a system for bees to move through the tunnel and attack ants. I also
            had to consider concepts such as health, food costs, and turn order to make the game functioning properly. This
            was a pretty large project, so efficient teamwork was very important.</p></dd>

        <dt><h4>About</h4></dt>
        <dd><p>Hog is a dice simulator game. Players take turns rolling dices and trying to be the first to reach a certain
            number of points. User can play against another person or a computer player. Computer can choose one of the
            playing strategies ranging from a naive one to a quite sophisticated and hard-to-beat one. There are special
            rules for rolling zero dice and reaching perfect square scores.</p></dd>
        <dt><h4>Skills</h4></dt>
        <dd><p>Working on the Hog project, I got practice with programming skills in Python, including use of control
            statements and higher-order functions. I also learned how to design and implement a simulation for a dice game
            and various playing strategies. I practiced debugging and testing my code. Additionally, working with a partner
            provided me with the chance to improve my teamwork and collaboration skills.</p></dd>
