    <dt><h4>About</h4></dt>
    <dd><p>The project is a toy-chat-app. Messages are broadcasted via WebSocket, so users can chat in real time!
    </p></dd>
    <dt><h4>Skills</h4></dt>
    <dd><p>While working on this project, I learned about the WebSocket protocol and the ActionCable feature.
         For the front-end, I decided to experiment and, instead of using the familiar Bootstrap,
          tried out Semantic UI, which I found to be very convenient and intuitive.
           Lastly, I gained hands-on experience with Redis.

    <dt><h4>About</h4></dt>
    <dd><p>The project is a toy-blog-app. Users can view published articles, filter them by Categories, 
        and read what they are most interested about. 
        Users can also sign up to be able to post, edit, and delete articles of their own. 
        The app has accounts with admin priveleges. Admins can create new categories, edit and delete any articles, and also delete user profiles. 
    </p></dd>
    <dt><h4>Skills</h4></dt>
    <dd><p>Implementing this project provided me with a comprehensive understanding of how Rails applications are built.
         I gained insights into the responsibilities of each part of the MVC (Model-View-Controller) framework and learned
          how migrations work. I also developed proficiency in creating CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete)
           functions and managing multiple resources.
        <br><br>
        Additionally, I built an authentication system from scratch and utilized Bootstrap for front-end development.
         I worked with one-to-many and many-to-many associations at the database layer and successfully deployed 
         the project to a production environment. 
         This project also allowed me to practice my skills with both Bootstrap and Ruby.

    </p></dd>
    <dt><h4>About</h4></dt>
    <dd><p>In this project, I built a 2D tile-based world exploration engine that generates pseudorandom levels. One of
        the most complex parts of the project was writing an algorithm that would draw rooms and hallways such that all
        the spaces are connected and no walls break into open space. User can save their progress, load the saved game
        and continue playing. Additional features include character animations, cut scenes, and sound effects.
        The player's task is to explore the level and eliminate all the monsters. Once the level is cleared, the boss
        will show up for the final fight.
    </p></dd>
    <dt><h4>Skills</h4></dt>
    <dd><p>This long software engineering project required a great deal of exploration and experimentation. The goal was
        to practice handling a larger piece of code in the hopes of emulating something
        like a product development cycle. It was a large design project that required me to work through every stage of
        development from ideation to presentation.
        Some of the most interesting aspects of the project were designing gameplay, adding music and sounds, and
        creating character animations.

    <dt><h4>About</h4></dt>
    <dd><p>A browser based tool for exploring the history of word usage in English texts. The program allows to graph
        how popular was a chosen word in a given year in English texts starting from 1470. User can enter multiple words
        and choose a time span of interest. Additional functions include search of hyponyms and finding the shortest
        path between two words.</p></dd>
    <dt><h4>Skills</h4></dt>
    <dd><p>The project had an emphasis on creating a custom data structure that would allow handling large amounts of
        data in an efficient manner. I learned how to work with big data, graphs, parse large cvs files, and manipulate
        the
        extracted data. Additionally, I had to do a bit of software engineering to set up a web server that can handle
        NgordnetQueries.</p></dd>

    <dt><h4>Skills</h4></dt>
    <dd><p>In this project, I learned about java GUI libraries. Buttons, fields, and event listeners - all that was new

    <dt><h4>Skills</h4></dt>
    <dd><p>Building this app, I became familiar with the underlying principles of neural networks, machine learning, and
        artificial intelligence. I learned how to pick the right model, training data of proper size and quality, and
        how to train the model then.</p></dd>

    <dt><h4>About</h4></dt>
    <dd><p>Working with two other students, made our very first contribution to an open-source project. Our mentor
        picked for us an open bug that seemed to be moderately difficult but turned out to be a deeply rooted version
        compatibility issue.</p></dd>
    <dt><h4>Skills</h4></dt>
    <dd><p>In this project, I learned what it means to dive head-on into an entirely unknown codebase of hundreds of
        thousands of lines of code. At times we were totally lost, and at times just super frustrated. But we cheered
        each other up and didn't give up. Only through efficient teamwork and close collaboration were we able to
        identify the root of the problem and find a fix to it.</p></dd>

<h3>Scheme Interpreter</h3>

    </p></dd>
    <dt><h4>About</h4></dt>
    <dd><p>The Scheme Interpreter project involved creating an interpreter for a subset of the Scheme programming
        language. The project required implementing the evaluation and application of Scheme expressions, as well as
        handling special forms and creating classes to describe Scheme expressions.</p></dd>
    <dt><h4>Skills</h4></dt>
    <dd><p>For this project, I had to learn the Scheme language and underlying principles of its work. I learned how to
        implement the evaluation and application of Scheme expressions, as well as handle special forms and create
        classes to describe Scheme expressions. Debugging and testing of my code took significant time as the project
        involved a lot of corner cases. Additionally, I gained experience with designing and implementing an interpreter
        for a programming language and get a better understanding how programming languages function behind the scenes.
        I had to think about the issues that arise in the design of a programming language and consider how they can
        impact the implementation of an interpreter. Working with a partner, I got a chance to further improve my
        teamwork, leadership, and collaboration skills.</p></dd>

    </p></dd>
    <dt><h4>About</h4></dt>
    <dd><p>Ants vs. Some Bees is a tower defence computer game. As the ant queen, you populate your colony with the
        bravest ants you can muster. Your ants must protect their queen from the evil bees that invade your territory.
        Irritate the bees enough by throwing leaves at them, and they will be vanquished. Fail to pester the airborne
        intruders adequately, and your queen will succumb to the bees' wrath. This game is inspired by PopCap Games'
        Plants Vs. Zombies.</p></dd>
    <dt><h4>Skills</h4></dt>
    <dd><p>The implementation involved a lot of object-oriented programming. I implemented various ant types, including
        HarvesterAnts and ThrowerAnts, and created a system for bees to move through the tunnel and attack ants. I also
        had to consider concepts such as health, food costs, and turn order to make the game functioning properly. This
        was a pretty large project, so efficient teamwork was very important.</p></dd>

        playing strategies ranging from a naive one to a quite sophisticated and hard-to-beat one. There are special
        rules for rolling zero dice and reaching perfect square scores.</p></dd>
    <dt><h4>Skills</h4></dt>
    <dd><p>Working on the Hog project, I got practice with programming skills in Python, including use of control
        statements and higher-order functions. I also learned how to design and implement a simulation for a dice game
        and various playing strategies. I practiced debugging and testing my code. Additionally, working with a partner
        provided me with the chance to improve my teamwork and collaboration skills.</p></dd>
