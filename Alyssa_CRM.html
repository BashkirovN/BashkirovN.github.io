      <dt><h4>About</h4></dt>
      <dd><p>Alyssa CRM receives quote requests from the website and Yelp. It then has to analyze the request and find what options the business can offer. The business has multiple teams working in different areas, having different job sizes, and thus starting and finishing at different times. The teams themselves can have 2-5 members and different size trucks. In doing the analysis, the program takes into consideration the current schedule and all the factors related to the teams. It does its best to balance the customer's convenience, idle driving miles, idle team hours, and providing a suitable size truck. If matching doesn't work perfectly, the program will suggest alternative options and may offer a discount if the customer agrees to be scheduled at a less convenient time. Once the customer decides to proceed, the job will be added to spreadsheets and the calendar, and the customer and each member of the assigned team will receive email and SMS notifications. The day before the job, the customer and each team member receive another SMS requiring them to confirm that they are ready for the move. If someone does not confirm, the manager will be notified. Additional functions include requesting feedback and reviews, tracking revenue, expenses, and performing accounting, monitoring the database of black-listed customers among moving companies, and keeping track of important due dates.</p></dd>

      <dt><h4>Motivation</h4></dt>
      <dd><p>As I was taking my first Java course, I was also helping my friend to start a moving company. One of my responsibilities was sending a lot of quotes every day. It's a repetitive task that requires a quick and accurate response. Sometimes I would spend too much time doing calculations, so the customer would move forward with another business, and sometimes I would make mistakes in a hurry. That's when I decided to apply my just-learned programming skills to improve my efficiency.</p></dd>
      <dt><h4>First Launch</h4></dt>
      <dd><p>A month later I rolled out my first build. The product was raw and downright terrible. My program would crash every few hours and I often had to spend long nights testing and debugging. Quite often I would sit in a class and a customer would write something ridiculous in their quote request sending my software to a crash and requiring me to respond to quotes manually.</p></dd>
      <dt><h4>Results</h4></dt>
      <dd><p>Despite a bumpy start, the initiative turned out a tremendous success. It reduced the manager's (that's me) workload by 80% and increased the business' revenue by 150%. As time went by and I was becoming a better programmer, I was improving my code and even had to rewrite almost the entire project twice. Throughout the years, the program got many new features and became a robust product.</p></dd>
